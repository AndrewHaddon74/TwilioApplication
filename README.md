***WARNING***
Incomplete Project

Twilio Application was a Java test bed for the Twilio API, a third-party Software as a service that allows you to send email and text messages. This test bed has two parts the reminder function that sends out reminders about appointments 24 hours before they happen. The second part of this project was a mass alert system, that would send out a single message to every number on a list. This project then ran into limitations when I the idea of having a web control interface was introduced. The project is now in the process of being ported over to a PHP backend with a HTML front end to provide the web control interface. No further work is planned on the Java part of this project.
